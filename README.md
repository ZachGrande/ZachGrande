### Some projects I've worked on

**Hockey Teeth**

I am in a band from Bellingham, WA called Hockey Teeth. I recently built a website to serve as a home for our audience, as well as an electronic portfolio for venues and labels.

**UW Capstone**

In June 2022, I led my Capstone team as we built a solution for young professionals struggling with Imposter Phenomenon. Our solution, Phenomenality, allows our audience to take quizzes and record accomplishments in the workplace. Authentication and data storage are deployed with Firebase. This project builds upon [Be Incredible](https://github.com/UW-INFO442-AU21/group4-in4matix), an early MVP developed with the same team.

**Avocado Sales Dashboard**

I completed a Data Visualization course at the University of Washington focused on visualizing unique data sets with JavaScript and D3. As part of my final project, I worked with a team to import and clean an avocado sales dataset to discover significant trends from 2015-2020. In another assignment, I extracted a dataset of Disney films to find which genres are most popular (highest grossing) and display how their most popular genre's income changed over time.

**Be Incredible**

An early concept website for my UW Capstone project. I led our team to create quizzes and a results dashboard with SurveyJS and CanvasJS. We learned to translate data across APIs and function as a team with stable software releases.
